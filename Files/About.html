            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hi there!<br>
I’m Angad Deep, a senior high school student from Uttar Pradesh, India, with an unwavering passion for Computer Science and Web Development. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve strived for excellence, earning top ranks across subjects and consistently being recognized as an Academic Scholar. I approach every challenge with dedication, whether in my studies or in extracurricular activities, as I believe growth comes from pushing beyond limits.<br>
My curiosity for technology and problem-solving drives me to explore a wide range of projects. I’ve developed web applications, mobile apps, and interactive games, with a particular focus on creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly solutions. A key milestone was my internship at GeniusHub, where I had the opportunity to design and develop a fully responsive "Testimonials" page. This project allowed me to delve into front-end development, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and seamless user experience that was well-received by both the company and its clients. Additionally, I was featured in Inspirin Magazine, a recognition that inspired me to continue honing my craft.<br>
Alongside my technical endeavors, I’m an avid chess player, earning accolades such as a trophy at the 44th International Torch Relay Open Chess Tournament. Chess has not only sharpened my strategic thinking but also enhanced my ability to approach problems with patience and precision. I am also an active member of an Astronomy Club, which fuels my fascination with the cosmos and its intersection with technology.<br>
As I look toward my future, I am eager to expand my knowledge in fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Software Development, and Data Analytics. I am excited to take my passion for technology and apply it to create meaningful, impactful innovations that push boundaries and improve lives. My goal is to contribute to the evolving tech landscape, whether through coding, research, or collaborative projects, and to continue learning from every experience along the way.<br>
Through a combination of academic dedication, hands-on experience, and a constant desire to challenge myself, I am committed to building a future where my skills can make a lasting impact.
